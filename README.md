OVERVIEW:

Our landing page is crucial. By designing an impressive landing page, we can create compelling content, draw viewers, and turn them into potential clients. Therefore, it's essential to comprehend what makes a landing page remarkable and what to avoid while building the website.
In this article, we'll learn how to use HTML and CSS to build a landing page.

INTRODUCTION:

Any web page on which a customer can land is a landing page, but in the context of marketing, it's typically a standalone page. In contrast to web pages, we design our landing pages with a single emphasis or goal, known as a "call to action." In essence, it's the next phase before a visitor converts to a client. It enables us to exchange contact information for trade, unique offers, pieces of information, or transactions. Landing pages are the ideal option for increasing the conversion rates of our marketing campaigns.
